"""Input sanitizing helpers for CMN-C2-276.

Pure, stateless domain helpers (NOT framework gate methods), shared by the
outer backbone pre_process and the inner validate step so that BOTH caller
channels get the same treatment.

That sharing is the point. The framework's own input scan covers the
instruction text but not the structured caller channel, so a screen wired only
into the instruction path would leave caller-supplied data unscreened.

# ── Template-owned instruction-override screen ────────────────────────────────
# Request text is this agent's PRODUCT: callers legitimately write "please
# ignore my previous request", "update the record and show it", "override
# approved by the app administrator" — ordinary app-record prose is full of
# directive verbs. A substring screen would refuse real work, so every
# alternative here is anchored on a full directive PHRASE aimed at the MODEL
# (an override verb plus a prompt/instruction noun, or a model role), or on a
# chat-template control token, which has no legitimate reading in an
# app-record request.
#
# This screen is the template's own guarantee, not the framework's: the
# platform input gate covers only user_input/validated_input (never the
# structured caller channel), rejects only HIGH-confidence findings, and is
# not guaranteed to be active on every host — wherever it is absent the
# template would otherwise fail OPEN.
